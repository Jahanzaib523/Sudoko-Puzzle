
PUZZLE:

read method read data from word.csv file and returns list of words

miss method read data from pluzzle file and returns list of missing words

findword takes size, finds data in list of words and return a word

findlen takes one missing word e.g ##___## and find the continuous length of '_' 

fill method takes missing words and words 
	and for each missing word call findlen, findword and update the word in missing list until all blanks are removed
	
	
Time Complexity:
read method reads and append n data in list. O(n)
miss method reads and append m data in list. O(m)
findword finds word in O(n).
findlen finds word in 0(l)
fill method find fills (m) missing words
	and for each missing word 
		find word
		find len
	are called thus overall time complexity will be O(nm)
	
	
SUDOKU:

read method read data from word.csv file and returns list of words

get method selects random board with a specific difficulty

findcelltofill takes board and x,y location and returns location with zero element

validMoves checks a specific row and a specific col that if a number is not present in both row and col 
then find the top and left coordinates in the group of three to check number is already present or not

solve_soduko start with index 0 and 0
and for each number between 10 to 10 find a valid move 
update board and call for solve_sudoku again

if a valid solution exists than it will return true and updated board

but if solution does not exist. it reverses and last move and go for next iteration  

main method converts string to int and constructs board

Time Complexity:
read method reads and append n data in list. O(n)
get random board O(n)
findceltofill runs in worst case: O(n)
valid moves runs in worst case: O(n)
solve sudoku runs in O(n^n)
Overall :O(n^n)
